            <p>After 57 years of marriage, Valenti and Maria Luísa’s love for each other is stronger than ever. So when their grandson Dani took them to the coastal town of Begur, he wasn’t surprised to see them turn the trip into their very own romantic getaway. They stayed at Emmanuel’s gorgeous villa, where Valenti and Maria Luísa canoodled in the gardens, frolicked by the sea and took turns letting each other win at ping-pong. It was a great trip and an even greater reminder that you’re never too old for young love. This is just one of the millions of trips that take place on Airbnb, made possible by Hosts.</p>
