         <p>Assigned as a mini-project, we were asked to answer a series of questions from our Interaction Lecture professor. 
             In addition to answering these questions, we were asked to code a website which reflects our answers. 
             The creative direction was left open-ended with only a select few requests from our professor. 
             I chose a simple, clean cut design to focus the attention on the questionnaire itself. 
             I focused on type hierarchy as it relates to the flow of the commentary.

         <p>This website was inspired by an exceprt from Junichiro Tanizaki's In Praise of Shadows. 
            I was inspired by his vivid imagery of traditional Japanese architecture, as well as the arbitrary relationship between shadow and light. 
            Requested to not use imagery, this project pushed my boundaries and made me step outside of my comfort zone.

         <p>
            This project was completed through Parson’s Core Interaction 2 creative coding class. We were asked to collect, 
            or create, a collection of 50 to 100 items. Our collections needed to include at least five different data type affiliated 
            with it. Additionally, we required to have a visual consistency between the items collected. From there, we were asked to trade our 
            collections with an assigned classmate. Through this, we designed a website for our partner’s collection connected to the API. 
            Through this experience, our goal was to make use of an API to design, and build an engaging and cohesive data visual.

    <p>For my final project of the semester, I created several Javascript filters. We were asked to create a website which deals with user input and output. 
        My page features an array of filters which can be used by the viewer, as well as an interactive drawing element through P5.js.

        Building off of what we learned in class, we were asked to create three more sections that each use a unique CSS Grid layout. 
        Each section should contain the following: between 3 and 8 photos, a title, subtitle, and a paragraph of text.

    This assignment was to practice documenting other's works in an exciting way. My partner was Shravani. 
    I was asked to observe my partner pairing and review their Stories as Networks project. Speaking with them about any highlights and main design details that are important to communicate, I 
    created a webpage that presented their project as though it were a case study. I included the name of the project, a link to view it, and at least one of the documentation techniques taught in class.

            Using what we learned during an in-class activity, we were challenged to create a page outlining an article from Wikipedia. Our goals were to; 
            <br>
            1. Choose a font that suits the subject matter.
            <br>
            2. Differentiate the headers and body text while keeping both readable.

            Asked to evaluate the provided writing sample and make a note of the hierarchy of information, we were given six challenges for our designs. 
            From utilizing only one type size, to just one font-weight, we had to display the information in an efficient manner.
