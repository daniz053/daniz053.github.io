      <a href=https://workable-glass-arch.glitch.me>CI Questionnaire</a>
      <h3>Assigned as a mini-project, we were asked to answer a series of questions from our Interaction Lecture professor. In addition to answering these questions, we were asked to code a website which reflects our answers. The creative direction was left open-ended with only a select few requests from our professor. I chose a simple, clean cut design to focus the attention on the questionnaire itself. I focused on type hierarchy as it relates to the flow of the commentary. </h3>
    
      <a href=https://noisy-tangible-closet.glitch.me>Sharing Commonalities</a>
      <h3>This was an in-class activity with three other group members. The objective was to discover a community between all of us. From there, we had roughly thirty minutes to outline a quick website. This website should illustrate our commonality in whatever way we see best fit. </h3> 
    
      <a href=https://daniz053.github.io/projects/storytelling/club.html>Cross-Platform Storytelling</a>
      <h3>Assigned to tell a story that begins with a web page, in a little over a week I created a multi-page website with embedded links. The objective was for our website to traverse at least three platforms in between, leveraging the strengths of each to help our reader visualize the story. For my story, I chose to focus on club culture in New York. More specifically, rave culture as it relates to college students. I left the narrative fairly open ended, but chose to have the overall experience a more personal one. The user is placed into the experience of going out to a rave. My website has different points along the way which allows the user to make decisions and interact with the interface. </h3>
     
      <a href=https://noisy-tangible-closet.glitch.me>Wikipedia Layout</a>
      <h3>Using what we learned during an in-class activity, we were challenged to create a page outlining an article from Wikipedia. Our goals were to; 
        1. Choose a font that suits the subject matter.
        2. Differentiate the headers and body text while keeping both readable.
        3. Incorporate images with text. </h3>
