# Welcome :)

Nice to meet you, this is my coding portfolio!

      My name is Zoey Poole, currently a Junior at Parsons School of Design studying Communciation Design.
      This repository is for documenting and archiving my coding as I continue to study interaction design.
      Many of these projects were completed based off projects in school, please visit my homepage to read descriptions,
      and to see chronologically my progress thus far.
