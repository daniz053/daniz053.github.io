    <div class="description-left">
        Assigned as a mini-project, we were asked to answer a series of questions from our Interaction Lecture professor. In addition to answering these questions, we were asked to code a website which reflects our answers. The creative direction was left open-ended with only a select few requests from our professor. I chose a simple, clean cut design to focus the attention on the questionnaire itself. I focused on type hierarchy as it relates to the flow of the commentary.

        Using what we learned during an in-class activity, we were challenged to create a page outlining an article from Wikipedia. Our goals were to; 
        1. Choose a font that suits the subject matter.
        2. Differentiate the headers and body text while keeping both readable.
        3. Incorporate images with text.
