    <div class="description-left">
        Assigned as a mini-project, we were asked to answer a series of questions from our Interaction Lecture professor. In addition to answering these questions, we were asked to code a website which reflects our answers. The creative direction was left open-ended with only a select few requests from our professor. I chose a simple, clean cut design to focus the attention on the questionnaire itself. I focused on type hierarchy as it relates to the flow of the commentary.

        Using what we learned during an in-class activity, we were challenged to create a page outlining an article from Wikipedia. Our goals were to; 
        1. Choose a font that suits the subject matter.
        2. Differentiate the headers and body text while keeping both readable.
        3. Incorporate images with text.

   We were given this assignment as an exercise for our basic HTML and CSS skills. Asked to evaluate the provided writing sample and make a note of the hierarchy of information, we were given six challenges for our designs. From utilizing only one type size, to just one font-weight, we had to display the information in an efficient manner.

<div class="description-right">
   This web page is uploading incorrectly on Github. It is showing up find in my other browsers. Building off of what we learned in class, we were asked to create three more sections that each use a unique CSS Grid layout. Each section should contain the following: between 3 and 8 photos, a title, subtitle, and a paragraph of text.

   This website was inspired by an exceprt from Junichiro Tanizaki's In Praise of Shadows. I was inspired by his vivid imagery of traditional Japanese architecture, as well as the arbitrary relationship between shadow and light. Requested to not use imagery, this project pushed my boundaries and made me step outside of my comfort zone.
