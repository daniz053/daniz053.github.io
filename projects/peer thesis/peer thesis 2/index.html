        <h1>What is Mindfulness?</h1>
        <h2> The Mindful definition of Mindfulness.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Mindfulness. Its a pretty straightforward word. It suggests that the mind is fully 
            attending to what's happening, to what you're doing, to the space yousre moving through. 
            That might seem trivial, except for the annoying fact that we so often veer from the matter at hand. 
            Our mind takes flight, we lose touch with our body, and pretty soon we're engrossed in obsessive 
            thoughts about something that just happened or fretting about the future. And that makes us anxious.</p>
            <h3> "Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are 
                and what we're doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what's going on 
                around us."</h3>
