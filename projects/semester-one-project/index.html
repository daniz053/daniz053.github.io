            <p>My home is the left over sailboat wallpaper from the family that lived in my house before me. It is the old windows that are glued shut but don’t keep the cold out. It is my cat meowing on the other side of my door every morning. The green kitchen that makes cooking less of a chore and more of a meditation. The creaking of the floor boards that I have memorized and the people behind the creaks that make a house a home.</p>

          <p>I sat, or more so, hunched over in my bed as per the regular agenda. I peered direct ahead and was within roughly a foot or two from me was my laptop. The entertainment which I viewed from my screen heavily rotated, but this cycle was Sims - it was going on week 2. The space I made for myself, was specific and meticulous. No item was placed without a certain reason or thought. It was a perfectly crafted enclosure - and I loved it. It was known to not disturb my peace and go about the house separate from my designated area. I had absolute territory and reign within the four walls. I felt safe and content here and one could arguably say too much so. But, I don’t care. We moved about a month or two before my graduation and pilgrimage to New York and I fought desperately to retain everything that room brought me. However, not amount of time could erase my familiarity. I will always remember it’s smell, the order, the comfort and above all how I felt there.

          <p>It is sitting at home with a view of the outside, from a window, a balcony, fire escape, a deck, or a porch on a bright overcast day, taking sips from a mug. It’s about the sounds and the smells of the outside: the wind chimes, and bird songs, and rain. Smelling damp earth or sand on the wind. I love bad weather, because it makes being cozy at home feel that much cozier and that much more like home. It also feels fresh. It is a cleansing- a purge of all thoughts, because the only thing to notice is the rain, hail, snow, thunder, or lightning, and how at home you feel.</p>

          <p>Recently, I’ve been feeling super nostalgic for home since my mom sold it a year ago and I didn’t get to part with it and I keep getting vivid memories of the floors in my house and how scratched up they were and how I began to memorize where certain scratches were in the floorboards which is really comforting 
            Also the way each door sounds differently when opened and closed is really prevalent when I think of my childhood home 
            Home feels really cluttered and overwhelming full of excitement since it’s filled with things I love (but don’t know how to organize them)
            Now home feels interchangeable and more centered within me in an adaptable way like a hub where I can create things comfortably.</p>

          <p>I remember visiting my uncle's home in Daegu, Korea. The love they showed to us was through food. Over 10 dishes of food on the table (Ban chan- Korean side dishes). The smell of this food became nostalgic, it became a form of feeling like I was home no matter the location, the compassion and hospitality that they had towards my family and I was something that had made me feel at home.</p>

          <p>I remember coming home on a blistery winter night. The snow from outside was seeping into my boots as quickly shuffled my way to the front door. Walking into my house, the warm air filled the air with comfort and love. The smell of hot chocolate made my stomach rumble. Waiting at the door was my mom with a wooly warm blanket she made herself. Once I touched the blanket, I knew that this was the feeling of home.</p>

          <p>When thinking of home a lot of the visuals that pop up in my head involve nature, my neighborhood up in the bronx has a lot of plants and trees and wildlife and I tend to feel most nostalgic for the springtime when we start to get a lot of blooming flowers and shade from the trees and for some reason my mind connects the idea of home that moment of rebirth in nature.I feel most comfort in thinking about the birds and butterflies and bees that come out when the temperature becomes warm again, I think the idea of warmth and growing warmth is why I associate home with nature! </p>

          <p>The place I feel most at home is with a good cup of warm coffee and reading a book. It's been a long time since I've been able to just have that moment to myself but when I take the space to breathe and just be, it soothes me. I'll sit in a warm space, blanket optional, facing the sun. If the weather permits, I'll even sit outside. The silence of it all quiets my mind and really helps me check in with myself. That is home for me.</p>

          <p>My home is a safe space for me. Time can change and I can love how my life in New York is but there is a gap i feel that gets fulfilled every time im home. I think its because it is a different country and I really miss the warmth of people and the food I grew up with. My house is big and red and filled with nature, most of my memories come from walking to our local park and doing trails and smelling the smell of humid rainforest. I love going back home, but I also know at 21 I need to experience something different than home in order to grow. I know home will always be there for me.</p>
