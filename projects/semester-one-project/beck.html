      <h2>ENTRY TWO</h2>
      <p>I sat, or more so, hunched over in my bed as per the regular agenda. I peered direct ahead and was within roughly a foot or two from me was my laptop. The entertainment which I viewed from my screen heavily rotated, but this cycle was Sims - it was going on week two. The space I made for myself, was specific and meticulous. No item was placed without a certain reason or thought. It was a perfectly crafted enclosure - and I loved it. </p>
      <p>It was known to not disturb my peace and go about the house separate from my designated area. I had absolute territory and reign within the four walls. I felt safe and content here and one could arguably say too much so. But, I don’t care. We moved about a month or two before my graduation and pilgrimage to New York and I fought desperately to retain everything that room brought me. However, not amount of time could erase my familiarity. I will always remember it’s smell, the order, the comfort and above all how I felt there.</p>
