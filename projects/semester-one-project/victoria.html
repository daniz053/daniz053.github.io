      <h2>ENTRY NINE</h2>
      <p>My home is a safe space for me. Time can change and I can love how my life in New York is but there is a gap i feel that gets fulfilled every time im home. I think its because it is a different country and I really miss the warmth of people and the food I grew up with.</p>
      <p>My house is big and red and filled with nature, most of my memories come from walking to our local park and doing trails and smelling the smell of humid rainforest. I love going back home, but I also know at 21 I need to experience something different than home in order to grow. I know home will always be there for me.</p>
