      <h2>ENTRY ONE</h2>
      <p>My home is the left over sailboat wallpaper from the family that lived in my house before me. It is the old windows that are glued shut but donâ€™t keep the cold out. It is my cat meowing on the other side of my door every morning. The green kitchen that makes cooking less of a chore and more of a meditation. The creaking of the floor boards that I have memorized and the people behind the creaks that make a house a home.</p>
