      <h2>ENTRY FIVE</h2>
      <p>I remember visiting my uncle's home in Daegu, Korea. The love they showed to us was through food. Over 10 dishes of food on the table (Ban chan- Korean side dishes).</p>
      <p> The smell of this food became nostalgic, it became a form of feeling like I was home no matter the location, the compassion and hospitality that they had towards my family and I was something that had made me feel at home.</p>
