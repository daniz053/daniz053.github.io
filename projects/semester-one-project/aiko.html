      <h2>ENTRY FOUR</h2>
      <p>Recently, I’ve been feeling super nostalgic for home since my mom sold it a year ago and I didn’t get to part with it and I keep getting vivid memories of the floors in my house and how scratched up they were and how I began to memorize where certain scratches were in the floorboards which is really comforting.</p> 
      <p>The way each door sounds differently when opened and closed is really prevalent when I think of my childhood home. Home feels really cluttered and overwhelming full of excitement since it’s filled with things I love (but don’t know how to organize them). </p>
      <p> Now home feels interchangeable and more centered within me in an adaptable way like a hub where I can create things comfortably.</p>
