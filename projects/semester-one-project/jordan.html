      <h2>ENTRY SIX</h2>
      <p>I remember coming home on a blistery winter night. The snow from outside was seeping into my boots as quickly shuffled my way to the front door. Walking into my house, the warm air filled the air with comfort and love. The smell of hot chocolate made my stomach rumble.</p>
      <p>Waiting at the door was my mom with a wooly warm blanket she made herself. Once I touched the blanket, I knew that this was the feeling of home.</p>
