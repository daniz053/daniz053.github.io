      <p>It is sitting at home with a view of the outside, from a window, a balcony, fire escape, a deck, or a porch on a bright overcast day, taking sips from a mug. Itâ€™s about the sounds and the smells of the outside: the wind chimes, and bird songs, and rain. Smelling damp earth or sand on the wind.</p>
      <p>I love bad weather, because it makes being cozy at home feel that much cozier and that much more like home. It also feels fresh. It is a cleansing- a purge of all thoughts, because the only thing to notice is the rain, hail, snow, thunder, or lightning, and how at home you feel.</p>
